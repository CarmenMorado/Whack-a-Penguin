# Whack-a-Penguin
100 Days of Swift (Project 14) A whack-a-mole game (except with penguins) using SpriteKit. Throughout this project, I practiced loops and GCD and learned about 
SKCropNode, SKTexture, masking, SKAction sequences, and more.

In addition, I completed the following challenges:
-Record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.
-When showing “Game Over” add an SKLabelNode showing their final score.
-Use SKEmitterNode to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole.
